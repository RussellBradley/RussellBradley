	Besides all the common touristy stuff, here are a few things I enjoy in Paris. 
	<br> 
	I included some things in Versailles even though I've never been
	<br>

	<br>
	On Canal St Martin: 
	<a href="http://lecomptoirgeneral.com">"Comptoir Général"</a> or <a href="http://www.pointephemere.org/">Point Ephémère</a>
	<br>They're both bars but also concert venues at night, so you could check out the events and see if anything cool's happening

	<br>
	<br>

	off Concorde metro station:
	<a href="http://maxims-de-paris.com">Le Maxim's</a>, it's a good cheap bar

	<br>
	<br>

	In the 6th quarter:
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-georges-paris-3">Chez Georges</a> also a cheap bar, you can buy a bottle of wine for 20 euros (cheap) but also glasses obvi.

	<br>
	<br>

	near Montmartre:
	<br>
	
	<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-fourmi-paris">Le Fourmi</a> (bar)

	<br>
	<br>

	<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-estaminet-paris">L'Estaminet</a> is a nice restaurant that isn't too expensive and serves typical French cuisine
	<br>
	<a href="http://www.lautrecafe.com">L'Autre Cafe</a> is a cute bar/cafe/restaurant
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/nuns-paris">Le Nun's</a> Cafe is another bar that's decorated with rando vintage/garage sale furniture items, kinda fun

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	Basically you can go anywhere in Oberkampf (near the intersection of 
	Rue St. Maur and Rue Oberkampf) at night and there will always be nightlife. Except maybe on Sundays.
	
	<br>
	<br>

	<a href="http://leloirdanslatheiere.com/">Pies the size of your face</a> it will get crowded so try to go on a random off hour, i don't know

	<br>
	<br>

	And then go to all the buildings that are famous. and the bridges. 
	great photo opps. and beautiful architecture.
