I've decided to do these mixes for folks who are curious about the songs I listen to. Instead of trying to remember, I've decided to make my own mixes and share it with everybody. The aweosome thing about these mixes is they serve multiple purposes. First and formost i'm selfish, so here is another way for me to listen to the songs I like using [mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/russellbradley/russells-fifteen-2212017/) as the outlet. Second this brings additional awareness to incredible underground artist who're looking for exposure. Lastly and as already mentioned you get to hear what i'm listening to any given time. 

I've also shared the playlist on spotify if you're anti-mixcloud - or just think my mixes stink - well you can listen to the playlist on spotify. Here is the second edition of Russell's Fifteen. Enjoy.

Share and tell your friends if you enjoy it.
